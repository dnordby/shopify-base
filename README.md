# VPV Base Shopify Theme

### Description:
This is V+V's work-in-progress Shopify base theme. When you start a new Shopify theme, you can pull from the Master branch to jumpstart setup by following the instructions below. Log feature requests in the [issues tab](https://github.com/verbalplusvisual/shopify_theme/issues), along with any actual problems/bugs.

If you are developing a new feature be sure to switch to a new branch on your local machine before beginning work and/or pushing to the repo. The master branch is protected, so only admins will be able to merge edits to the master, produciton branch. To submit pull requests for review, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/verbalplusvisual/shopify_theme/pulls) for your branch - be sure to include notes on the changes/updates.
